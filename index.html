    <p> The Aeropress is a coffee maker invented in 2005 by Alan Adler. He is also credited with the invention of the aerobie frisbee (those ring things). Since the Aeropress's inception there have sprouted a number of different brewing methods. This innovative gadget has even inspired an international brewing competition. This page is dedicated to help you up your game by brewing the best cup of coffee possible and consequently becoming the life of the party. </p>
